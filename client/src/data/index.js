    title: "What times do you deliver and collect the bouncy castle?",
    info: "Unless other arrangements have been made at time of booking we schedule to do all our deliveries in the morning between 8am – 12noon, and start collecting them in again from 6pm. We find that these times suit most people, as parties are generally in the afternoon. It just depends how busy we are, and what areas we are covering, as to what time we collect from each house. However, if your party is starting earlier, or going on a bit later, we are happy to discuss delivery and collection times to suit your party times.",
  },
  {
    title: "How much space is needed for a bouncy castle?",
    info: "Ideally, you need a 3ft gap each side of the castle, this leaves us enough room to stake it down. Behind the castle, you need a 5ft gap as this is where the fan has to go and placed far enough away from the rear of the castle to prevent injury should someone fall from the rear wall. In front of the castle you need to make sure you have a clear area so children can get on and off safely, about a 5ft gap minimum.",
  },
  {
    title: "Is there anything I need to do?",
    info: "No, we do all the heavy work so you can get on with preparations for your party. All we ask is that, before we arrive, you clear a passageway for us to pull the trolley through with the bouncy castle on (minimum 3ft gap). Make sure you have left enough room for us to get pass any parked cars on the driveway, we don’t want to scrape pass your pride and joy, and that you have cleared a big enough space in the garden where you want us to put the castle, ie, cleared the area of any animal soil, sharp objects (ie washing line holes) or any other debris..",
  },
  {
    title: "Do I need to supply anything?",
    info: "We need access to a plug socket to plug in our extension lead. Preferrably trailing the lead from a window not a door to avoid the cable being trapped/damaged should the door get closed. We carry 25mtr and 40mtr extension leads on the van, (that’s about 75ft and 120ft in old money!). Please let us know at time of booking if the inflatable will be further away from an electric point than that as you may need a petrol fan or generator which can be booked in advance at extra cost.",
  },
  {
    title: "How long does it take to set up the inflatable?",
    info: "On average it takes about 15-20 minutes in total to deliver and set up a bouncy castle or slide, and about 25-35 minutes for an obstacle course, this is assuming we have good access and the area is cleared where the inflatable is going.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do you have insurance?",
    info: "Yes. We have £5million Public Liability insurance. This covers you when we are delivering/collecting the inflatable, setting up and pulling down, if the unfortunate was to happen and we should damage any of your property, you have peace of mind that you can claim off our insurance. But rest assured – we are professional in our approach, and take every care and have never had a claim yet. Once the castle is erected, we will run through a few basic safety checks, pointing out any risk areas and ask you to sign a copy of our terms and safety procedures. Once we have left the site, the supervision of the inflatable and it’s users is down to the hirer.",
  },
  {
    title: "Can I take out my own insurance against accidents?",
    info: "In most cases, your own domestic house insurance will already cover you for the bouncy castle and it’s users. If this is something you are worried about, call your insurance company and discuss this with them. If you are not covered already, they may be able to issue you with a short term policy to cover the party for a small fee!",
  },
  {
    title: "Can adults go on the inflatables?",
    info: "Sorry NO! Unless you have hired an “Adult “ inflatable they are not permitted to go on and would not be covered if anything was to happen. Adult bouncy castles are made differently with deeper beds and higher walls to accommodate adults or “big kids”. If adults use our inflatables and they get damaged, it is the responsibility of the hirer to pay for any repairs or replacments, so please – NO ADULTS!",
